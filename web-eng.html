                    1 - Front-end
                    <br>2 - Back-end
                    <br>3 - Full-stack
                    <br>
                    <br><i>Front-end</i>
                    <br>Frontend web development, also called client—side development, is the creation of websites using programming languages or CMS. The interface developer is responsible for coding and programming the website elements visible to site visitors. Front-end developers and web designers often work together to create designs and interfaces for specific brands.
                    <br>For example: Text, buttons, comment field
                    <br>
                    <br><i>Back-end</i>
                    <br>Backend development - sometimes called server—side development — usually involves complex programming languages such as PHP, Java, Node.js and SQL. The backend developers are responsible for the more technical aspects of the website that take place "behind the scenes" and are invisible to site visitors.
                    <br>For example: Working buttons, sending a comment to the server, changing the theme of the site when you click on the button
                    <br>
                    <br><i>Full-stack</i>
                    <br>Fullstack developers are perhaps the most in-demand. They write code for the external and internal interface of the site. They are well versed in how both components work separately and together. Companies that need a website created from scratch can contact the full-stack developer.

                    <br><i>Programming languages (required):</i>
                    <br>1.HTML
                    <br>2.CSS
                    <br>3.JavaScript
                    <br>
                    <br>Languages for Front-end:
                    <br>1.JavaScript
                    <br>2.HTML и CSS
                    <br>3.TypeScript

                    <br>5.Swift
                    <br>
                    <br>Languages for Back-end:
                    <br>1.Java
                    <br>2..NET
                    <br>3.PHP
                    <br>4.Python
                    <br>5.C++
                    <br>
                    <br>Web developers are divided into 3 types:
                    <br>Junior - beginner
                    <br>Middle - developer middle level
                    <br>Senior - expert
                    <br>
                    <br><i>The website development process includes 6 stages:</i>
                    <br>1.Task Discussion stage - Developers collaborate with web designers and the client to determine the purpose, objectives, target audience, services and functions of the website.
                    <br>
                    <br>2.Content Stage - Web developers use the data obtained during the task discussion stage to create a roadmap for the website, which, in fact, is a plan for all the main topics that will be covered on the site.
                    <br>
                    <br>3.The design stage - the two most important aspects of web design are the target demographic and the function of the site. For example, a social networking site for young people should be very different from an online store aimed at older men.
                    <br>
                    <br>4.Development Phase - Web developers use the information they collect - along with their skills — to create a working website.
                    <br>
                    <br>5.The launch stage - the developers check for all the details, including taking into account customer feedback. They evaluate its performance and check whether the site is displayed on smartphones and desktop computers. When everything is ready, the site code is uploaded to the server for publication. Then the site is launched and becomes available for public viewing.
                    <br>
                    <br>6.The maintenance phase - the launch of the site — is not the end of the road. A live website needs regular maintenance to keep it running at full capacity.
