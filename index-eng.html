                    There are 7 basic types (categories) of programming: 
                    <br>1. Aspect-oriented languages
                    <br>2. Structural
                    <br>3. Procedural
                    <br>4. Logical
                    <br>5. Object-oriented
                    <br>6. Functional
                    <br>7. Multi-paradigm
                    <br><b>Aspect-oriented programming</b> A programming paradigm based on the idea of separating functionality to improve the division of a program into modules.
                    <br><i>The most popular languages are: AspectC++; AspectJ; AspectLua</i>
                    <br><b>Structural programming</b> A programming paradigm based on the representation of a program in the form of a hierarchical block structure.
                    <br><i>The most popular languages are: Basic; Pascal; QBASIC</i>
                    <br><b>Procedural programming</b> Programming in an imperative language, in which sequentially executed statements can be assembled into subroutines, that is, larger integral units of code, using the mechanisms of the language itself.
                    <br><i>The most popular languages are: Pascal; PHP; Lua</i>
                    <br><b>Logic programming</b> A programming paradigm based on mathematical logic — programs in it are set in the form of logical statements and rules of inference.
                    <br><i>The most popular languages are: Mercury; Prolog; Curry</i>
                    <br><b>Object-oriented programming</b> A programming methodology based on the representation of a program as a collection of interacting objects, each of which is an instance of a certain class, and the classes form an inheritance hierarchy.
                    <br><i>The most popular languages are: C++; C#; Java</i>
                    <br><b>Functional programming</b> A programming paradigm in which the calculation process is interpreted as calculating the values of functions in the mathematical understanding of the latter (as opposed to functions as subroutines in procedural programming).
                    <br><i>The most popular languages are: F#; Cat; Clean</i>
                    <br><b>A multi-paradigm programming language</b> A programming language that was developed specifically as a multi-paradigm programming tool, that is, the expressive capabilities of which were originally supposed to be inherited from several, most often unrelated languages of various paradigms.
                    <br><i>The most popular languages are: Python; C++; JavaScript</i>
